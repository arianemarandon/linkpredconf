By Ariane Marandon.

This repository contains our implementation of the conformal link prediction method introduced in the paper "Conformal link prediction for FDR control"(https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14693).

Requirements:
```
numpy==1.24.2
torch==2.0.0
torch_geometric==2.3.0
```

See notebook in this repository for a tutorial. 

Parts of the code are taken from the [implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SEAL_OGB) of the link prediction algorithm "SEAL":
